CShell is a replacement for the standard Amiga shell.

- Press the HELP key to see a list of built in commands. After you assign
  CSH: to where csh.doc is, you can also enter 'man <command>'.
- After you have started csh, you can remove the disk you booted from,
  as all important commands are built in.
- All built in commands may be abbreviated. Instead if typing 'assign',
  just enter 'ass'. If you don't like this, enter 'set _abbrev n'.
- Built in commands have to be lowercase. Therefore, to force an external
  command to be used, capitalize the first letter: 'Dir df1: ALL'
- All commands (even externals) accept wild cards. The asterisk '*' is
  the same as #? under AmigaDOS:  'copy *.c ram:'
- Quick installation: Call csh at the end of your startup-sequence. Create
  a file s:.login where you put all your private alias commands.
- The alias command is very powerful: 'alias hi "%a echo $a$a"' will echo
  twice what you passed to it as argument. aliases may call each other.
- Whenever you need to specify a file name, just type the beginning of it
  and press TAB then. Repeat if necessary.
- After you type 'cd -g DH0: DH1:' (insert your partitions here), you can
  cd to any directory anywhere on the hard disk without specifying a path.
- You can set the function keys to any string you like: 'set _f1 dir^m'
  will execute a 'dir' command whenever you press f1.
- You can recall all old lines by typing the up and down arrow. If you type
  the beginning of an old line and press shift-up, it will reappear.
- CShell has all important properties of a programming language. CShell
  scripts can do very complicated tasks. Refer to csh.doc for details.
- You can control application programs with a REXX port without having
  AREXX running:  'rxsend rexx_ced CEDTOFRONT'
