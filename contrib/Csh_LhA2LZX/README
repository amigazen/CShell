Simply copy the file LhA2LZX.sh to CSH: and type and type LhA2LZX in a
directory where you have some LhA archives.
They will be converted (only if LZX is better)  in all the path.
Don't forget to edit the script a while to set some variables.

If you find something bad or if you like it feel free to email me at

Thank you for downloading LhA2LZX :-)
