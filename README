Welcome to the 5.20+ series of C-Shell (Csh).  Hey, what does "5.20+" mean?
And who is "Andreas M. Kirchwitz"?  What happened to "Urban D.  Mueller"?
We don't need no WIMPY Csh 5.x -- we want Csh 6.x!  NOW!!!

                                   STOP!


Lemme explain, "5.20+" means "5.20 and up". May I introduce myself?  My name
is "Andreas M. Kirchwitz" and currently I'm the keeper of the source (KOTS).

What's new?  Csh 5.20+ is totally ARP free and OS 2.0+ only.  Plus bug fixes
and lots of enhancements.  Since Cshell is now maintained by a new author,
the version number should be increased to "6.x".  Well, you better don't ask
why this hasn't been done ;-)  Some day it will... some day...

Special thanks must go to Gary Duncan for bug reports and enhancements
request (incl. source code).  Thank you, Gary!

I recommend that you read the "HISTORY" file.  No joke -- READ IT!
First of all, some important points if you upgrade to 5.20+.

 - Csh only runs on AmigaOS 2.0 (or higher).

 - Csh 5.20+ uses dos.library (or pattern.library if installed) for
   pattern matching. That means, you CANNOT USE ARP-PATTERNS any more.
   But pattern matching is still only done when there's a "*" or "?".

 - Csh uses DOS resident list.  (ARP is gone :)
   Internal command "resident" works on DOS resident list.

 - Csh-Scripts MUST end with ".sh".  If you call a Csh-Script you MUST
   type the name WITHOUT the ".sh" extension.

 - You can start DOS-Scripts from Csh.  (do NOT use "execute"!)

 - "s:login.sh" and "s:cshrc.sh" are obsolete.
   Use "s:.login" and "s:.cshrc" now.

 - Options of internal "assign" have changed.

 - Internal command "path" works on DOS path list.

 - Default output format of "dir" changed.   (supports links)
 
 - Lots of new commands and variables.


You better read the history file for a full list of changes!!


Hopefully I forgot nothing ;-) And now...  HAVE FUN with this new Csh.
If you send bug reports, please be so exact as you can. Include an example
how to reproduce the bug. Write me the version numbers of your Csh and
AmigaOS. If you report Enforcer hits please send the complete Enforcer and
SegTracker output. Otherwise it's of no earthly use.
